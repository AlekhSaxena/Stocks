## Algo Trading and Quant Analysis Projects
This repository is dedicated to showcasing my projects in algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis. These projects demonstrate the application of various algorithmic strategies and machine learning techniques to optimize trading decisions, manage risk, and maximize returns.

## Projects Overview
### Monthly Portfolio Rebalancing

This project involves the creation and maintenance of an investment portfolio through algorithmic strategies. The algorithm recommends stocks to add or remove from the portfolio based on specific criteria set for performance, risk, and diversification. Additionally, the strategy includes a trailing stop-loss mechanism to enhance returns and mitigate risks. This approach ensures that the portfolio adapts to changing market conditions, aligning with the set investment goals.

### Daily Recommendation Based on Neural Network

Utilizing neural networks, this project aims to predict daily stock returns. The model processes various market indicators and historical data to forecast whether a stock's return will exceed 1% on a given day. This prediction serves as a signal to execute trades. The accuracy and reliability of these predictions are continually assessed and improved through backtesting and optimization techniques.

### Intraday Strategies

This project encompasses a range of intraday trading strategies, including but not limited to MACD, RSI, OBV, Renko, and Breakout strategies. The focus is on developing a robust system that can automatically execute trades based on these strategies. The system is hosted on AWS to ensure scalability, reliability, and real-time data processing. The strategies are designed to capitalize on short-term market movements, and their performance is evaluated based on various metrics to ensure consistent profitability.
